    <h1>Introduction to the Attack</h1>
    <b>Understanding the fundementals of volleyball is extremely important to understanding the roles each player has.
    The basic idea to volleball is to not let the ball touch the floor on your side, and to make it touch the other teams side.
    Each time the ball touches the floor, one team gets a point.
    Doing both these tasks aren't extremely complicated, but over time, we've developed the ideal ways to score points.
    Defense is extremely important to preventing being scored on but without a proper offense, you'll never win.
    The most basic form of offense is the ability to "spike" a volleyball.  Once you've understood how, real volleyball is played.
    Volleyball is a game of technique combined with natural and developed athleticism.
    I would be lying to you if I said your height isn't important.  The higher you can reach when you jump, the better your chances of scoring.
    Players who are shorter still can play by utilizing proper technique.<br><br>
    </b>
    <h1>How to attack</h1>
    <p>During a game of volleyball, there is a player called the "setter".
      This person is the main tactition of the team.  They will decide who will be attacking.
      The setter should throw the ball high enough for you to hit the ball downward with top spin.
      This means you will be required to jump with precision, react with accuracy, and strike with timing.
      The theory is extremely easy to understand but the executing, especially during a game, can be tricky.
      You'll find that jumping at the right time can be tricky, striking high requires surgical precision,
      and the perception to strike around a blocker isn't as easy as the explanation.
    </p>
    <h1>Step 1: Pre-Jumping</h1>
    <p>Before even jumping, you will need to fine tune your approach to ensure you're consistant before nailing down the strike
    Most people will do a similar approach to basketball.  They will step out with their non-dominant foot, then sprint to the jump
    location using a two step approach.  Watch the video to understand what an approach should look like.<br><br></p>

    <h1>Step 2: Jumping</h1>
    <p>I hope you've prepared your legs because this is the trickiest part.  You'll need to condition your legs to be able to jump the highest you are capable of
      Start training your legs via plyometrics to make your jump height higher.  After you've stretched and practiced your approach, you can try to jump.
      When you jump, you want to be 45 degrees from the net.  It will prevent you from jumping into the net, resulting in a point for the other team.
      Reach up with both hands like you want to catch the ball at the highest point of your jump.  To get the highest jump point possible, swing your arms forward
      before catching the ball will add a few centimeters to your vertical.
    </p>
    <h1>Step 3: Hitting</h1>
    <p>The most satisfying part of the spike is the slam from scoring the set.  The burning sensation from slamming the ball will be the highest high you feel.
      It is what makes me come back for more.  The final step is to hit the ball with a upward spin to bring the point to the team.  This is achieved by imitating the Nike "Swoosh"
      Placing your hitting arm back and preparing to swing requires consistancy to continue to practice.  Using your supporting arm, you'll aim for where you should swing.
      Hitting the ball slightly in front, over your shoulder is key to achieving the perfect spike.
