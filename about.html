    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <b>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Nhan Nguyen.  The simple pronounciation of my name is "Na-an Wh-in".
        Its quite a simple name to pronounce, but can throw people off because of the spelling.
        I'm a 1st generation American with Vietnamese ancestors with my parents being the first to arrive in the states!
        A little about myself: I'm 29, going on 30 with strong interests in software development. When I was a kid,
        I had strong interests in games.  Spending hours and hours, learning the different worlds that others
        created for me was so interesting.  I had nothing but respect for the story tellers of the digital age.
        In my adolescence and late teens, learning to code never became reality.  My schools never taught it as a class and I
        never found a chance to learn.  In my early adult life, I enlisted in the military.  "The world is my oyster"... so I thought.
