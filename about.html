      <p>
        Hello! My name is Nhan Nguyen. The correct pronounciation is quite difficult so most people just call me "Na-an Wh-in".
        The name comes from Vietnam, so the spelling is confusing for most Americans.  During the Vietnam war, my parents fled the war torned country to find a 
        small town in Michigan named Grand Rapids.  They flocked to the industrial and economic boom at the time, hoping to find themselves in Detroit.  My father,
        found success working his way up with General Motors.  My mother worked a nail salon across the street from the factory my dad worked at.  One thing led to
        another and my mother found herself pregnant, only for the great General Motors bubble to burst.  My father had to quit his job and join my mother at her
        nail salon.<br><br>

        I was born in November 25th, 1994, having joined the military as my primary profession.  Some of my favorite activities include: Cooking, Sports, and Gaming.
        Food from other cultures are so interesting to me, and that curiosity led me to become decent at cooking.  I love cooking soups, noodle dishes, bento boxes and
        anything fried.  My favorite sports are: Volleyball, tennis, and soccer.  Playing sports is always significantly more fun then watching sports however, I have
        a soft spot for my home towns teams.  Ever since I was young, gaming has been close to my heart.  It's what propelled me into software development in the first
        place.  The stories that can be told, the communties that get built, nothing beats playing a good video game.
